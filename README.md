# weather-app

This project is a weather application that shows you the weather of the city or location you input to the search bar. If you input an invalid location, you will get the default weather information, which is of the city that I am from.

## Motivation

I built this application as part of The Odin Project's required assignments. It helped me to learn how to properly use api's and repackage the information they give into useable bits that I can implement on own projects!

## How to use?

Enjoy!
